      6         In 1997, United States President Bill Clinton announced the challenge to develop an AIDS
      7         vaccine by 2007. Since 1997, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) has published
      8         annual reports on the global status of the effort to meet Clinton's deadline. Last year's
      9         report, entitled “AIDS Vaccine Trials—Getting the Global House in Order,” officially ends
     10         the countdown. Saying that “we are on a long term mission,” AVAC concludes that there will
     11         not be a safe and efficient vaccine in 2007, and that we need to “focus on the long haul
     12         and set an agenda for sustained and sustainable action that stretches well beyond 2007.” It
     13         is not that there are no vaccine candidates in clinical trials, but there is little hope
     14         that any of the current candidates will turn out to be a cheap and safe vaccine that
     15         affords long-term protection.
     16         Among notable developments over the past 12 months, the AVAC report highlights the
     17         Global HIV/AIDS Vaccine Enterprise as an effort to improve coordination within the AIDS
     18         vaccine field. The Enterprise was announced in June 2003 and now shares its scientific
     19         strategic plan with everyone affected by the AIDS pandemic—that is, all of us—by publishing
     20         it in 
     21         PLoS Medicine (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020025).
     22         In its plan the Enterprise presents itself as a global endeavor and emphasizes the need
     23         for integration and capacity building around the world. It is not “a discrete organization
     24         with a pool of money” but a “coordinating group of individual funding agencies that will
     25         support specific areas of research using their own mechanisms, according to their own
     26         practices and policies, and following the Enterprise's principles.” These principles
     27         include collaboration, standardization, and coordination among international researchers
     28         and agencies. The plan focuses on specific scientific roadblocks that need to be overcome,
     29         but also looks ahead and mentions the need to build capacity for product manufacturing and
     30         clinical trials, and to address regulatory issues.
     31         These are noble goals, and the fact that they are stipulated jointly by many of the
     32         leaders in the field will generate excitement and expectations, even though much of what is
